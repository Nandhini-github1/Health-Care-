<h1><center>PRACTICE GOOD HYGIENE</center></h1></div>



<p>&emsp;&emsp;Personal hygiene is all about managing your body hygiene, essentially caring for your well being incorporating some physical hygiene habits. Also, there are mental health benefits as well, as they affect each other immensely.</p>
<p>
&emsp;&emsp; Those little unconscious acts like picking your nose or ear with your finger, or habitual ones like not brushing your teeth properly, these are all bad personal hygiene.</p> <br>

<br>

<h2>1. Take Regular shower</h2><br>
&emsp;&emsp;<p>Do not wait up to feel the dried sweat in your body to feel the urge to take shower, make it a routine, you have the choice to either take them before you head to work or after the long day or even before you head to sleep, whichever one suits your routine. Make sure to rinse your body thoroughly, especially the genitals and underarms as they produce more sweat and are more prone to fungal activities.</p>
<br><br>


<h2>2. Wash your hands frequently</h2><br>
&emsp;&emsp;<p>It is our hands that we use to do our most physical acts, from picking up the keys, browsing through our phones to attending our pets. While we acknowledge the importance of washing hands before eating and after visiting the toilet, it is also important to wash our hands with soap or sanitizer every now and then. </p>
<br><br>

<h2>3. Maintain oral hygiene practices</h2><br>
&emsp;&emsp;<p>Caring for your teeth and gum is important, not only to prevent decay related issues but also as they affect neurologically some other sensual organs, they shouldn’t be taken in a light manner. Just brushing them twice a day is not enough, make sure you are using fluoride toothpaste and brushing properly.  </p>
<br><br>


<h2>4. Trim your nails and wash your hairs </h2><br>
&emsp;&emsp;<p>Your nails and hair store dirt and grease. None not to mention the microbes could be in there stuck and spreading. Bad nail hygiene can cause severe food poisoning since you would be preparing or eating your food with your hands. Trim the nails every once they are inappropriately long and wash your hairs at least twice a week to keep them healthy.</p>
<br><br>

<h2>5. Wear fresh and warm clothes </h2><br>
&emsp;&emsp;<p>Try to change into some warm and dry clothes, you’ll feel the mental effect immediately as they will boost your mind. Also, regular washing with right detergent matters since like your body, your clothes can be contaminated with germs or microbes, especially if they have been used for several days.</p>
