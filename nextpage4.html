<h1><center>MOVE YOUR BODY</center></h1></div>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Many people strive to be fit. Fitness, after all, is synonymous with health.

Having a high level of overall fitness is linked with a lower risk of chronic disease, as well as a better ability to manage health issues that do come up. Better fitness also promotes more functionality and mobility throughout oneâ€™s life span.

And in the short term, being active can help your day-to-day functioning, from better mood to sharper focus to better sleep.</p>
<p>
&emsp;&emsp; Physical activity can lower the risk of long-lasting disease and improve balance and coordination. It can help with weight loss, sleep and self-esteem<br><br>

<br>

<h2>1. Measure your fitness level</h2><br>
&emsp;<p>Learn about your fitness level and write down your scores before you start your program. Use the scores as benchmarks against which to measure your progress.</p>
<br><br>
<p>To measure your aerobic and muscular fitness, flexibility, and body composition, write down:</p><br>
<li>Your pulse rate before and right after walking 1 mile (1.6 kilometers).</li><br>
<li>How long it takes to walk 1 mile, or how long it takes to run 1.5 miles (2.41 kilometers).</li><br>
<li>How well you move through the full range of motion in your hips, knees, ankles, shoulders and elbows.</li><br>
<li>Your body mass index (BMI).<br><br>

<h2>2. Design your fitness program</h2><br>
&emsp;<p>It's easy to say that you'll exercise every day. But you'll need a plan. As you design your fitness program, keep these points in mind:</p><br><br>
<li>Think about your fitness goals</li><br>
<li>Make a balanced routine</li><br>
<li>Start slow and go forward slowly </li><br>
<li>Build activity into your daily routine<br><br>


<h2>3. Get started</h2><br>
&emsp;<p>Now you're ready for action. As you begin your fitness program, keep these tips in mind:</p><br><br>
<li>Start slowly and build up gradually</li><br>
<li>Break things up</li><br>
<li>Be creative</li><br>
<li>Listen to your body<br><br>

<h2>Check your progress</h2><br>
&emsp;&emsp;<p>Assess your fitness six weeks after you start your program. Then do it again every few months. How are you doing? You may need to add more exercise time. Or you may find that you're exercising about the right amount to meet your fitness goals.

If you lose motivation, set new goals or try a new activity. Exercise with a friend or take a class at a fitness center.</p><br><br>
