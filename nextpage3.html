<p>&emsp;&emsp;While it may seem like there’s nothing you can do about stress at work and home, there are steps you can take to destress and regain control.</p>
<p><h2>What is stress management?</h2></p><br>
&emsp;&emsp;<p>Effective stress management helps you break the hold stress has on your life, so you can be happier, healthier, and more productive. The ultimate goal is a balanced life, with time for work, relationships, relaxation, and fun—and the resilience to hold up under pressure and meet challenges head on. </p><br>

<br>

<h2>Tip 1: Identify the sources of stress in your life</h2><br>
&emsp;<p>Start a stress journal
A stress journal can help you identify the regular stressors in your life and the way you deal with them. Each time you feel stressed, make a note of it in your journal or use a stress tracker on your phone. Keeping a daily log will enable you to see patterns and common themes. Write down:</p><br>
<li>What caused your stress (make a guess if you’re unsure).</li><br>
<li>How you felt, both physically and emotionally.</li><br>
<li>How you acted in response.</li><br>
<li>What you did to make yourself feel better.<br><br>

<h2>Tip 2: Cut out unhealthy ways of dealing with stress</h2><br>
&emsp;<p>Many of us feel so stressed out, we resort to unhealthy and unproductive ways to cope. A lot of these unhelpful strategies can temporarily reduce stress, but in the long run, they actually cause even more damage</p>
<li>Smoking, drinking too much, or using drugs to relax.</li><br>
<li>Bingeing on junk or comfort food.</li><br>
<li>Zoning out for hours in front of the TV or phone.</li><br>
<li>Withdrawing from friends, family, and social activities.<br><br>


<h2>Tip 3: Practice the 4 A's of stress management</h2><br>
&emsp;<p>When deciding which option to choose in any given scenario, it's helpful to think of the four A's: avoid, alter, adapt, or accept.</p>
<li>Avoid unnecessary stress</li><br>
<li>Alter the situation</li><br>
<li>Adapt to the stressor</li><br>
<li>Accept the things you can't change<br><br>

<h2>Deal with stress with mindful rhythmic exercise</h2><br>
&emsp;<p>While just about any form of physical activity can help burn away tension and stress, rhythmic activities are especially effective. Good choices include walking, running, swimming, dancing, cycling, tai chi, and aerobics. But whatever you choose, make sure it's something you enjoy so you're more likely to stick with it.</p><br><br><br>
